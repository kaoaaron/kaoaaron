I'm an Engineering graduate that decided to change careers to follow my passion of becoming a software developer. I have over 2 years of experience as a Full Stack Developer but I have been programming since 2012. My skills are now focused on web development, but my skills expand far beyond that. I have programmed in a wide variety of languages in the last decade, such as Swift, Java, JavaScript, C, C#, C++, Assembly, Bash, and pretty much everything you can think of!

Here are my top languages according to my Github. Most of my work is private in company repositories so this doesn't truly reflect my current expertise in JavaScript.

## ðŸŒŸ Hobbies

Outside of software development, I love always trying new things. I love doing exercise and routinely go on difficult hikes, go to boxing classes, do hot fitness classes, and play a multitude of sports. I have been taking skating lessons and guitar lessons in the past year, but before that, I took a variety of language courses. In my spare time at home, I like to unwind by playing video games and watching anime. Here are my songs that I have recently listened to on Spotify:
